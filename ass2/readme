This contains the instructions for execution of the code.
We have to run make in the console and it will open an
interactive sml environment and then we have to write 
"use \"load.sml\"" and then to execute the lexing and parsing
we have to pass an inputfile to the parse_File function along with the
outputfile to store the post order traversal value.

Sumarizing the above in steps:

Step1: $make

(*-----opens sml interactive environment------*)

Step2: -use "load.sml";
Step3: -parse_File ("inputfile","outputfile")

(*This will print the tokens as a list for every line in the program
and then we can check the postorder traversal of the Abstract Tree in
the output file we have mentioned*)
